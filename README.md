# list_of_projects
I have ideas for projects, but I don't write them down or keep track of those ideas. This is where I can do that!

## Project 1: React / JS checklist creation
The idea is to create sort of a 'todo list', but in a checklist format. I was inspired by following a few guides on how
to setup different things on docker. I always run into a situation where I forget the specific steps on how to do something, but I don't
to read an entire guide to get the specific steps. I can remember the why to do a command, but I have a hard time remembering the syntax.

As I describe it, it sounds like a "recipe" app. Like how to cook food. I guess it kind of is, but I want it for code and setting up docker
and other "checklist" type actions. I plan on creating the frontend in React, or maybe use vanilla Javascript, but I really want to learn more
about React. (I don't know why, maybe because it's still an in-demand skill??) 

I also want to switch up my backend skills. I like working in python and using Flask, but I want to venture out to use other things. I will research
more ideas and update as neccessary.

## More Projects

This list will keep growing, but for now, one is fine. I also want to document my journey, so hopefully I'll keep this updated.
